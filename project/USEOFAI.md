# USE OF AI

## Shaders
The fire and light animations were created with the assistance of AI. It helped us design the sinusoidal functions used to animate both the vertex positions and the color dynamics of the fire.

## Helicopter Bucket 
AI support was instrumental in defining the movement behavior of the bucket, particularly during helicopter maneuvers such as directional changes and forward motion.
