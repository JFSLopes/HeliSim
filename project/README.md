# CG 2024/2025


## Observations

- Everything that was asked was implemented.
- An extra feature was developed: a **smooth transition in the helipad texture** (option **b**) was added.
- Additionally, the following features were implemented:
  - Collision detection with the **forest** when dropping water.
  - If the drop **misses the forest**, the fire is **not extinguished**.
  - The **lake water is animated**, providing a dynamic visual effect.
  - A **falling water animation** was added for realism during drops.

## Controls

- **P** – Pull up  
- **L** – Pull down  
  - If over the **lake**, the bucket is filled with water.  
  - If not, the **autopilot** will return to the helipad (or pull down if already above it).  
- **W** – Accelerate  
- **S** – Brake  
- **A** – Steer left  
- **D** – Steer right  
- **O** – Drop water  
- **R** – Restart simulation  

## Interactive Scene

There is an **interactive way to modify the scene**:  
- Change parameters in the interface.  
- Apply changes using the **Update Scene** option.
