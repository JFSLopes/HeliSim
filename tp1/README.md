## TP 1 Notes

- In exercise 1, we observed how to create and connect points, and how the order in which they are connected influences which face will be visible. Additionally, we investigated how the interface and scene objects work, including how to create new objects and how to add a checkbox in the interface to control the visibility of certain objects. 
- In exercise 2, we didn't have difficulties. Since the triangles to be shown were similar (only differing in size), we created an auxiliary class (`MyTriangleAux`) that contains the logic to build that kind of triangles. Both `MyTriangleSmall` and `MyTriangleBig` extend that class.
