## TP 2 Notes

- In Exercise 1, we struggled until realizing that, as discussed in theoretical classes, we should invert the order of the geometrical transformations. Once we figured this out, we managed to finish the exercise very quickly, as the figures were already created.
- Exercise 2 was completed quickly without difficulties.
- The main challenge in Exercise 3 was the rotations required to create the cube from the defined planes. Before doing this, we thought the final result of Exercises 2 and 3 would be the same, but in the end, we noticed some differences in the lighting effect.
